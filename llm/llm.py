llm.py

This script fine-tunes a small GPT-2 model (distilgpt2) on a sustainable software engineering (SSE) dataset
and performs inference to demonstrate generation capabilities.

Dependencies:
    pip install torch transformers datasets

Steps Performed:
1. Load a custom SSE text dataset.
2. Fine-tune the GPT-2 model (distilgpt2).
3. Generate a completion for a prompt using the fine-tuned model.
